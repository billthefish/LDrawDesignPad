HOW TO COMPILE LDDP
----------------------------------

You'll need:

* Borland Delphi. 
	Delphi 2006 is used for development but it may build in
	earlier versions down to Delphi 6

To compile this source successfully, you'll also need to download 
and install the following component suites:

* Delphi Scintilla Interface Components 0.50
	http://delphisci.sourceforge.net

* JVCL 3.33 with JCL 1.101
	http://jvcl.sourceforge.net
	Note: The LDDP code is incompatible with JVCL 2.x

* Custom modifications to the Delphi Scintilla Interface Components 0.50
	Overwrite the files in the defualt package with the ones
	in the delphisci directory located in Package Modifications

LDDP uses Scintilla for it's editor control.  An LDraw lexer has
been written but not yet added to the Scintilla project.  If you
wish to build your own Scintilla dll:
	- Overwrite the files in the default distribution with the 
	  ones in the Scintilla directory located in Package Modifications.
	- Run the LexGen.py script in the src directory
	- Run the HFacer.py script in the include directory
	- Build Scintilla with your favorite C compiler
If you don't want to build Scintilla then simply use the SciLexer.dll
in the /lddp/Exe directory
