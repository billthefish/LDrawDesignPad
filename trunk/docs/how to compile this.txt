HOW TO COMPILE LDDP
----------------------------------

You'll need:

* Embarcadero Delphi. 
	Delphi XE2 is used for development but it may build in
	earlier versions down to Delphi 6 (this has not been tested)

To compile this source successfully, you'll also need to download 
and install the following component suites:

* JVCL and JCL (currently using JVCL 3.45 and JCL 2.4.0)
	http://jvcl.sourceforge.net
	Note: The LDDP code is incompatible with JVCL 2.x or lower

* SynEdit
	http://synedit.sourceforge.net
	Note: Since the Synedit developers don't seem to like to
	release packages very often, LDDP uses the current SVN 
	snapshot for development
