HOW TO COMPILE LDDP
-------------------

You'll need:

- Borland Delphi. (Delphi versions 6 and 7 have been used in production, but Delphi 4 or higher should work)

To compile this source successfully, you'll also need to download and install the following component suites:

* Jedi VCL - http://jvcl.sourceforge.net
* SynEdit  - http://synedit.sourceforge.net
            (After extracting the synedit sources copy the files from the CVS 'LDraw Synedit mod'
             module over the existing files. Then install it as described in the SynEdit documentation.)
* ICS Internet Component Suite - http://overbyte.delphicenter.com/

If you should still have problems to compile this,
please ask in the HELP-Forums at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/lddp.


That's all!  Have fun!

The LDDP project is looking forward to your contribution ;) !
