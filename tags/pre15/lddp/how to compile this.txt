How to compile this program?

Preferences:

- Delphi 4 or higher (not sure about this since I am using Delphi 6, but it should work)

You need the following component suites to compile this source successfully:

* Jedi VCL - http://jvcl.sourceforge.net
* SynEdit  - http://synedit.sourceforge.net
  After extracting the synedit sources copy the files in the LDrawHighlighter.zip over the existing files
  then install it as described.
* ICS Internet Componen Suite - http://overbyte.delphicenter.com/

That's all!

Have fun!

The LDDP project is looking forward to your contribution ;) !
