HOW TO COMPILE UNOFFICIAL LDDP VCL
----------------------------------

You'll need:

- Borland Delphi. (Delphi version 6 or up required)

To compile this source successfully, you'll also need to download and install the following component suites:


* SynEdit  - http://synedit.sourceforge.net
             Note: you will need the newest released CVS snapshot

* JEDI-VCL  - http://jvcl.sourceforge.net

Note:  This is a unofficial side project.  This mean that the most current features of the
       Official version of LDDP may not be implemented in this unofficial version.  Please
       email me complaining about this.  -Orion
