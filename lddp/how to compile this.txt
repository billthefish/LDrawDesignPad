HOW TO COMPILE LDDP
-------------------

You'll need:

- Borland Delphi. (Delphi version 6 or up required)

To compile this source successfully, you'll also need to download and install the following component suites:


* SynEdit  - http://synedit.sourceforge.net
            (After extracting the synedit sources copy the files in the LDrawHighlighter.zip
             over the existing files then install it as described in the synedit documentation.)


That's all!  Have fun!

The LDDP project is looking forward to your contribution ;) !
