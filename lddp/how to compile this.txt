HOW TO COMPILE LDDP
-------------------

You'll need:

- Borland Delphi. (Delphi versions 6 and 7 have been used in production, but Delphi 4 or higher should work)

To compile this source successfully, you'll also need to download and install the following component suites:

* Jedi VCL - http://jvcl.sourceforge.net
* SynEdit  - http://synedit.sourceforge.net
            (After extracting the synedit sources copy the files in the LDrawHighlighter.zip
             over the existing files then install it as described in the synedit documentation.)
* ICS Internet Componen Suite - http://overbyte.delphicenter.com/

That's all!  Have fun!

The LDDP project is looking forward to your contribution ;) !
